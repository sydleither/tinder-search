 # Tinder Search

A chrome extension that will search through tinder for a profile with the given name. It will swipe left on everybody who does not have that name, and stop on the first profile with the name.

## How to Use
1. Download all of the files in this repository. Make sure they are unzipped, in a folder called "tinder-search".
2. In chrome, click the ellispies in the top right corner. Click "More tools", then "Extensions".
3. On the extensions page, click "Load unpacked" in the left corner. Select the folder "tinder-search".
4. An icon of a magnifiying glass should appear on the right corner on the toolbar. Go to Tinder, sign in, and type the desired name in the popup after clicking the magnifiying glass icon on the toolbar.
